1. Despite the name, the oddities function actually returns an array containing elements
   which have an EVEN index position. That said, even though the output and values in the arrays
   match, the returned array and the original are different objects. The equality operator on arrays
   returns true only when both arrays are the same object.

2. Same answer.
